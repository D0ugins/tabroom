	The Tabroom system began as two projects; the CAT (Computer Assisted Tab)
	by Jon Bruschke, from Cal State Fullerton, and Tabroom.com by Chris Palmer,
	from Massachusetts

	Many new debate tabulation features, including the integrated debate
	tabulation system, were supported by a grant from the Open Society
	Foundations. 

	It is now an ongoing supported project of the National Speech and Debate
	Association.
