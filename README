	The Tabroom system began as two projects; the CAT (Computer Assisted Tab)
	by Jon Bruschke, a college debate coach in California and Tabroom.com by
	Chris Palmer, a high school speech & debate coach in Massachusetts

	Many new debate tabulation features, including the CAT and the integrated
	debate tabulation system, were supported by a grant from the Open Society
	Foundations. 

	It is now an ongoing supported project of the National Speech and Debate
	Association.
