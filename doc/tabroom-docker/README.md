# A development environment for tabroom.com

## Overview
This document describes setting up a development environment for the software powering tabroom.com

You'll want to ensure you have the following prerequisite software packages installed
 - docker-ce [https://docs.docker.com/install/] 
 - docker-compose version 3 [https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/]
 - s3cmd - amazon s3 cloud storage command line tool
 - pv - the pipe viewer

All other dependencies should be resolved by the docker virtualization platform.

## Setting up the development environment

1. Clone a copy of the git repository into /www/tabroom.

`git clone https://github.com/NationalSpeechandDebateAssociation/tabroom.git /www/tabroom`

2. From the docs/docker directory, build the docker container from the Dockerfile

`cd /www/tabroom/doc/docker && docker build . -t tabroom-app`

3. Create a copy of General.pm in /www/tabroom/web/lib/Tab

`cp /www/tabroom/web/lib/Tab/General.pm.default /www/tabroom/web/lib/Tab/General.pm`

4. Edit /www/tabroom/web/lib/Tab/General.pm to meet your needs and user credentials. Most of the configuration is self documenting.
This document assumes the root password for the docker managed MySQL instance is "root" and the user-space credentials are "tabroom:tabroom". The docker-compose instructions in `docker-compose.yml` assumes the internal network addressing calls the tabroom.com database "db". Editing the relevant parts of the source can look something like this:

`$hostname = "localhost:8000";`

...

```
#Database name
$dbname = "tabroom";
#Database host.  "localhost" will use the mysql local socket, not the network
$dbhost = "db";
#Database username
$dbuser = "tabroom";
#Database password
$dbpass = "tabroom";
```

5. Start the docker containers by using the docker-compose script.

`docker-compose up`

This will help you evaluate any errors that may stem from your setup or this process using dockers logging utilities.

6. Download & import a copy of the tabroom.com database.

You may use the docker-database-sync bash script to accomplish this, or if you've been provided a copy of the database, you can use it as an example of how to get the database into the docker-managed MySQL container.

the relevant lines to build from is: 

```
docker exec -u root $(docker ps -f=name=tabroom-docker_db -q) /usr/bin/mysqladmin -u root -proot create tabroom
pv tabroom.sql | docker exec -i $(docker ps -f=name=tabroom-docker_db -q) /usr/bin/mysql -u root -proot tabroom

```

7. Point your browser to `localhost:8000` to verify the webserver system has started up, and is reading from the database.
