			Login below with your NSDA Points Application username and password
			to connect <% $person->email %>'s Tabroom.com account with your
			National Speech &amp; Debate Assocation login.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Only do this with YOUR login</strong>, not your teammate,
			co-coach's, or anyone else's.  Using another's login, even if you
			use it regularly for access, will break your online
			ballots, team management, and many many other things.  
		</p>
			
		<p>
			We will have to undo it, and the process is pretty rough.
		</p>

		<p>
			But people tend to ignore errors and click through instructions
			assuming they know what it says already, even when they don't.  So
			I have to force the issue: to ensure you have read this paragraph
			and haven't just skipped the instructions, you must type "I am this
			person and no other" in the confirmation box below.  </p>

		<p>
			That phrase has a nice medieval flair, I think.

		<h4>How it works</h4>

		<p>
			Once you have linked your roster, points will be posted for each
			future tournament on Tabroom.  They are usually posted early in the
			week, on Monday or Tuesdays.  Tournament directors do not have to
			take action to post them. 
		</p>
			
		<p>
			To confirm your points, log into the NSDA points system (
				<a href="http://points.speechanddebate.org"
					>http://points.speechanddebate.org</a> )

			and click the Auto-Post button that will appear above your roster.
			Confirm the points there, and designate coaches, and your
			points will post.
		</p>

		<p>
			Alas, however: points from tournaments that happened before you
			link your school records to the NSDA cannot be retroactively
			posted.
		</p>
