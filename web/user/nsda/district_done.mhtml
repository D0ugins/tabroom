		<h2>That's it!</h2>

		<P>
			Your district tournament has been created and registered with the
			NSDA office. 
		</p>

		<h5>If you're running on Tabroom</h5>

		<p>
			There may be additional configuration you want to do.  Each judge
			group has been set up to separate judges in Speech, Congress and
			Debate with default obligations, but you may want to change some of
			that configuration.  You may also need to change the defaults for
			double entry policies.  You can do all that in the usual place,
			under the Settings menu when you go into the tournament.  
		</p>

		<p>
			Remember also the question mark icon on the top right leads you to
			the Help manual for Tabroom.
		</p>

		<h5>If you're running on JOT</h5>

		<p>
			Notification has already been sent to the folks at Joy of Tournaments
			with your information to get you set up.  You'll only need to access
			your tournament on Tabroom for three things:

			<ol>
				<li>
					If your tournament dates change, please go into your Tabroom
					District tournament, and change them under Settings - Tournament -
					Dates and Deadlines.  You will also have to make this change
					on JOT's website. 
				</li>

				<li>
					If you change your mind and need to order plaques or ballots,
					you can either email the office or indicate your order under
					Settings - Tournament - NSDA
				</li>

				<li>
					Once your tournament is done, you should upload your JOT
					data file into Tabroom under Settings - Tournament - NSDA.
					Once uploaded there, your qualifying entries will be ready
					to be registered for Nationals.
				</li>

			</ol>

		</p>
