			<h5>Districts Signup Notes</h5>

			<p>
				This year, you should create a district tournament series
				within Tabroom whether or not you will be using it to tabulate.
				The Tabroom district listing will inform the NSDA Office of
				information we need to know about events, dates, and locations.
				Also, once your district tournament(s) are finished, you will
				upload results into Tabroom even if you tabulation on Joy of
				Tournaments.
			</p>

			<p>
				This process will streamline both Nationals registration, and
				will allow district chairs to confirm promotion of alternates
				for declined entries to Nationals. 
			</p>

			<p>
				All districts on Tabroom will consist of one and only one
				master tournament.  You can configure a tournament to run on
				multiple weekends now to support that; the tournament will have
				separate dates, registration deadlines, etc for each weekend
				you run on.
