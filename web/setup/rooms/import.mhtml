		<p>
			I'm going to level with you: computers are really stupid.  It takes
			a lot of effort to make them smart.  Therefore, the file you upload
			must be formatted precisely.  All files must be in raw ASCII text.
			If you save in Excel into CSV format, that will be acceptable as
			long as the fields are in the proper order.  Do not put single or
			double quotes or commas into the text fields; all kinds of bad will
			happen if you do.  Do not upload a Word doc or a PDF or anything
			other than a text file or a CSV file.
		</p>

		<p>
			The rooms file must be in the format: 
			
			<pre> 
				Name,Quality,Capacity,Notes,Acccessible,Map URL
			</pre>
		</p>

		<p>
			One room per line.  Only the room name is required; you can leave
			all other fields blank and the room will still import.  Leave
			fields blank but mark them with commas if you want to use later
			ones; so if you want to include notes but not bother with quality
			or capacity numbers, do this: 

			<pre>
				Room 214,,,Extemp Room Only,
			</pre>
		</p>

		<p>
			Ratings for quality and capacity must be numerical.  Lower numbers
			mean "better" quality and will be used first; "capacity" is solely
			for your information and is not automatically used by Tabroom.
