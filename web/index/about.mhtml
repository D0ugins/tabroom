			<p>
				If you're a student, coach, or parent and have a question about
				a particular tournament, <span class='inline semibold'>email
				them directly</span> - they're more likely to be able to help you.
				Contact information can usually be found in the tournament invitation.
			</p>

			<p>
				If you're having trouble using the Tabroom software itself, try
				the manual using the question mark in the top right corner, or
				here:

				Tabroom Documentation
			</a>

			<p>
				If those don't work or your question deals with something
				private (e.g. personal student info, access needs) email us
				at:
			</p>

			<a href="mailto:help@tabroom.com" class="yellow full">
				help@tabroom.com
			</a>

			<p>
				To run a tournament on Tabroom, log in and hit "Request a
				tournament" on the right hand toolbar.  The how-to guide is
				available from the question mark icon on the top right corner.
				No approval, pre-notification or cost is required to register
				or tabulate a tournament on Tabroom.
