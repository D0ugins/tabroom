		<h4>Import NSDA.json file</h4>

		<p>

			You must first create the .json file from within Rich Edwards' NSDA
			nationals program; select Format &rarr; Make JSON file.

		</p>

		<p>
			Then use the control below to find the file and click the button to
			upload it.
		</p>

		<p>

			The file will be in the /bin folder in the directory that the NSDA
			program is located in and will be called "DataAsJson.txt".

		</p>

		<p>
			This will ERASE all existing data and replace it with what you
			upload, so be careful.
		</p>

		<p>

			The total upload time can take over 2 minutes, depending on how
			much data there is in there.

		</p>
