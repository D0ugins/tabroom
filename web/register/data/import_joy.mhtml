		<h4>Import Data from Joy of Tournaments</h4>

		<p>
			You must have created divisions/events and judge categories for the
			import to proceed properly.  The division/events are matched based
			on name; thus the division/event names in Tabroom must exactly
			match the names in the Joy and the Joy export file.
		</p>

		<p>
			Additionally, constraints on times and against schools will be
			listed in judges' notes section, but cannot be automatically added;
			you will have to manually enter them in as judge strikes.
